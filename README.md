# 🪙 Crypto Coin – A Blockchain-Based Cryptocurrency Simulator

An educational project that simulates a cryptocurrency ecosystem using core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** principles. Built from scratch, this project demonstrates blockchain logic, transaction chaining, wallet balance tracking, mining with proof-of-work, and a modern React-based frontend.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This simulation models real-world blockchain components with a focus on learning. It includes:
- A custom blockchain built using **Linked Lists**
- **Transaction Pool** implemented via Queues
- Mining with **Proof of Work** and SHA-256 hashing
- React-based interface for wallet, transaction, and block viewing

---

## 🎯 Objective

To apply foundational DSA and cryptographic techniques to build a realistic, interactive blockchain simulation — serving as a strong learning platform for concepts in **fintech**, **cryptography**, and **decentralized systems**.

## 🧩 Key Features

- ⛓️ **Custom Blockchain** with Genesis Block & Block Chaining  
- ⛏️ **Proof of Work Mining Algorithm** using Nonce Difficulty  
- 🔐 **Secure Hashing** with SHA-256  
- 👛 **Wallet Balance Tracking** through Transaction History  
- 🧾 **Role-based Transaction Submission** and Mining Rewards  
- 🌐 **Responsive React UI** with real-time mining feedback and blockchain explorer
